        <p> I was approached in the fall of 2015 to help design the graphics and website for a Student Body President and Vice President Campaign at
          Kansas State University. After discussing with the candidates what their vision was for K-State and with knowledge of their extensive
          background in the Student Governing Association, I decided to help. Over winter break, I worked to develop a set of graphic ideas and logos
          that would convey the various ideas and emotions of the campaign.

        <p> These two pages demonstrate my first ideas for the logo. Some of the original ideas I was trying to represent were strong, trustworthy
          and unity. I also liked the ideas of using the same shades of the same color of blue, this went along with a motif that we wanted to carry
          throughout the entire campagin of unity. This would symbolize unifying the campus around a set of common ideas in additon to  unifying
          two candidates. After continuing to work through the basic ideas for the graphic content and running into a number of bumps in the road, I
          began to produce a large variety of graphics for the campaign ranging from t-shirts, posters, infographics and even GIFs for twitter usage.
          A number of these graphical items can be seen at the bottom of the page.

        <p> The next and final step for the majority of my work was to create the website for usage throughout the campaign. I started off with local
          devlopment using MAMP to test on my laptop. I utitilized a free template courtesy of <a href='https://html5up.net/'>HTML5UP</a>. This allowed me to begin a quick development
          process, with a known set of design features in a short amount of time. Most of my time was spent tweaking the design including changes to both
          the HTML and CSS of the template. I also implemented a custom splash landing page that was used at various times during the campaign. The full website
          can be viewed on the <a href='http://vanrankenkennedy.com/'> Van Ranken | Kennedy website </a> and the source code can be viewed on the
          <a href='https://github.com/vanrankenkennedy/vanrankenkennedy.github.io'> github page </a>
